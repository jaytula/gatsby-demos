# Search Engine Optimization (SEO) and Social Sharing Cards with Gatsby

## Implementation

Most important is having a meaningful `title` tag. Some crawlers also respect
`meta` tags but Google does not appear to do so.

## Gatsby + GraphQL

Gatsby distinguishes between page-level queries and component queries.

Page-level queries can use page GraphQL queries (by `export const query`)

Component queries can use `StaticQuery` which is parsed, evaluated and injected
at build time. This allows fallback to sane defaults while providing
extensibility.

## Creating the SEO component

- Imports

```javascript
import { Helmet } from 'react-helmet'
import { useStaticQuery, graphql } from 'gatsby'
```

- Then in function component `src/components/seo.js`, create foundation for SEO component.

```jsx
const SEO = ({ description}) => {
  const { site } = useStaticQuery(
    grqphql`
      query {
        site {
          siteMetadata {
            title
            description
            author
            keywords
            siteUrl
          }
        }
      }
    `
  )

  const metaDescription = description || site.siteMetadata.description

  return null;
}

export default SEO
```
